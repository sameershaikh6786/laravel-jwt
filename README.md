# Laravel API Integration with JWT Authentication Token Using Jquery

## Install laravel
Before creating this project, make sure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed.

laravel new version 11 is just arrived. So I used here laravel 10. I will create a fresh laravel app.
````
composer create-project laravel/laravel:^10.0 laravel-api-jwt
````
Once the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using Laravel Artisan's serve command:
````
sameer_shaikh_task
 
composer update
````
php artisan key:generate
````
php artisan serve
````
## Setup Database
By default, your application's `.env` configuration file specifies that Laravel will be interacting with a MySQL database and will access the database at `127.0.0.1`.
````
DB_DATABASE=sameer_shaikh_task
````
Now you have to  create a database by this name `sameer_shaikh_task` into your local machine `xampp` server. 
Once you have configured your `MySQL` database, you may run your application's database migrations, which will create your application's database tables.
